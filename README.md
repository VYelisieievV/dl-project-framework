# dl-project-framework
Pytorch flexible configuration framework for deep learning projects.

Goals:
* Create system, that is easy to use in multiple projects different deep learning based projects.
* Deep learing part based on Pytorch (Pytorch Lightning or (maybe?) Catalyst)
* Highly configureable arhitecture via .yaml files
* Logging and metrics
* capable for collaboration

Maybe airflow ?
